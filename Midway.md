## Midway Blog Post - Stefan Stanojevic, Kevin Qualls

In our initial blog post, we wrote about training a neural network on the dataset of Gomoku games, in order to predict the next move made a human player would make. Since then, we have taken our project a step further and coded an AI Gomoku player that can gradually improve its skill through self-play and reinforcement learning.

Since we were curious about whether our neural network has actually learned important elements of the game or not, we decided to quickly code a self-playing module and visualize its performance.

For this project, we set out a goal of implementing algorithms something akin to Google's DeepMind to devise an AI capable of playing the game of Gomoku at a competitive level. 

Similar to Connect Four, Gomoku is like Connect Five (Go means 5 in Japanese, and moku means pieces [[1]](http://www.opengames.com.ar/en/rules/Gomoku) ). There are ample documentations online for how to build a Connect Four AI, as the game is relatively simple and requires less computational power [[2]](http://www.opengames.com.ar/en/rules/Gomoku). On the other hand, documentation for how to build an AI Gomoku is sparse, likely due to its abstract strategy on a 15 x 15 gameboard setting [[3]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312325842_Move_prediction_in_Gomoku_using_deep_learning). Rather than seeing this as a setback, we welcomed the challenge to deepen our understanding of neural net architectures and machine learning AI.  


Training the network on expert games (around 10000) to recognize the next move and reward function. Some snapshots of our dataset ...

Neural net architecture and training stuff ... this will take a day or so

For this project, we set out a goal of implementing algorithms something akin to Google's DeepMind to devise an AI capable of playing the game of Gomoku at a competitive level. 

Similar to Connect Four, Gomoku is like Connect Five (Go means 5 in Japanese, and moku means pieces [[1]](http://www.opengames.com.ar/en/rules/Gomoku) ). There are ample documentations online for how to build a Connect Four AI, through 

Training the network on expert games (around 10000) to recognize the next move and reward function. Some snapshots of our dataset ...

Neural net architecture and training stuff ... this will take a day or so

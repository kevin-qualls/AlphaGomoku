For this project, we set out a goal of implementing something akin to DeepMind's algortihms to devise an AI capable of playing the game of Gomoku at competitive level.

Similar to Connect 4, Gomoku is like Connect 5, since Go means 5 in Japanese, and moku means pieces.

Training the network on expert games (around 10000) to recognize the next move and reward function. Some snapshots of our dataset ...

Neural net architecture and training stuff ... this will take a day or so
